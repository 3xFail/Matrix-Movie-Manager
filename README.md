<b>Description:</b>
This is a pet project that I will be using for my senior project at Oregon Institute of Technology. I will be using C# to create a moive management system, similar to plex, to manage my media library. This repository is where everything will be stored, minus the movie content. The purpose of this project is to make it easier for the user (me) to find a movie in my library. Also there will be a few features that I will be adding to make the program more usefull than a cataloging program.

<b>Technologies:</b>

GUI: Windows Presentation Forms
Logic: C#
Database: MS SQL

<b>Inspiration:</b>

My insperation for this idea came out of annoyance. I have a pretty decent sized movie library. Large enough to make it annoying searching for a movie using file explorer. My hope is that this project will not only help me learn more about c#, WPF and MS SQL, but will also eliminate the need for me to use windows explorer to search for my movies and play them ever again.
